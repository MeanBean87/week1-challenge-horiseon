# Week 1 Challenge Exercise - Horiseon Webpage

## Description

This is not an actual company.

This is a homework challenge that required the student to update code to satisify the below user story:

User Story

```plaintext
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

Acceptance Criteria

```plaintext
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

The source code did not follow proper HTML semantics, many overly used div containers and improper use of HTML tags as well as a broken link. The images did not provide accessibility for screen readers. The CSS file contained many redundant declarations that caused significant code bloat and sections needed to be commented to provide better readability.
